<li>Some programmers also complain about its lack of multiple inheritance, a powerful feature of several object-oriented languages, among others C++. The Java language separates inheritance of type and implementation, allowing inheritance of multiple type definitions through interfaces, but only single inheritance of type implementation via class hierarchies. This allows most of the benefits of multiple inheritance while avoiding many of its dangers. In addition, through the use of concrete classes, abstract classes, as well as interfaces, a Java language programmer has the option of choosing full, partial, or zero implementation for the object type he defines, thus ensuring maximum flexibility in application design.

<li>??????? (Inheritance).

<li>There are some books on OOP that will tell you that the cornerstones of object oriented programming are encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, or something along those lines. This is fairly typical of the classic OOP view, and there's nothing wrong with it per-se, it's just that we've generalized some ideas and decoupled things here and there since then.

<li>Looking at other popular languages : Multiple Inheritance is not a feature of Java, whereas it is used in C++ and Python[citation needed].

<li>Inheritance accomplishes a similar feat

<li>You can also have this interest using a common super class but a class can only inherit from one super class whereas it can implement several interfaces. Java does not support full orthogonal multiple inheritance. Java does not allow you to create a subclass from two classes. Multiple inheritance in C++ has complicated rules to disambiguate fields and methods inherited from multiple superclasses and types inherited multiple times. By separating interface from implementation, interfaces offer much of the benefit of multiple inheritance with less complexity and ambiguity. The price of no multiple inheritance is some code redundancy; since interfaces only define the signature of a class but cannot contain any implementation, every class inheriting an interface must provide the implementation of the defined methods, unlike in pure multiple inheritance, where the implementation is also inherited. The major benefit of that is that all Java objects can have a common ancestor. That class is called Object. When overriding methods defined in interfaces there are several rules to be followed:

<li>The purpose of this section is to help you understand the terms; we will delve more into the benefits in the sections on encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, and on and on. However, let us say that while the "low-level" way might seem shorter and simpler, the object oriented benefits accrue with program size and complexity. This is not surprising, as that's what OOP was designed for, but it does make simple examples hard to come by. So bear with us.

<li>In many books, inheritance and OOP are made to seem synonymous, so it may seem strange that we deferred this discussion so far. This is a reflection of the diminished role of inheritance over time. In fact, one of the primary distinctions between Classic and Modern OOP lies in the usage of inheritance. As the old adage goes, if all you have is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail. And so it happened that often times, inheritance was the only tool available to the erstwhile OOP programmer, and so every concept under the sun (or at least the ghostly glow of a CRT) was crammed into inheritance. This lack of conceptual integrity and separation of concerns led to over-intimate dependencies and many difficulties. In some languages, programmer technique evolved to make the concepts clearer using the same limited language functions, while other languages explicitly developed features to address these concerns. Because you are almost certain to be exposed to some of this misguided advice at some point in your OOP learning, we'll try and explain some of the problems to you. However, much of the discussion will go in the sections where they properly belong!
