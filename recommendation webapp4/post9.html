<li>It is possible that you have the Java runtime (JRE), but not the JDK. In that case the javac program won't be found, but the java -version will print the JRE version number.

<li>Reflection is the mechanism by which Java exposes the features of a class during runtime, allowing Java programs to enumerate and access a class' methods, fields, and constructors as objects. In other words, there are object-based mirrors that reflect the Java object model, and you can use these objects to access an object's features using runtime API constructs instead of compile-time language constructs. Each object instance has a getClass() method, inherited from java.lang.Object, which returns an object with the runtime representation of that object's class; this object is an instance of the java.lang.Class, which in turn has methods that return the fields, methods, constructors, superclass, and other properties of that class. You can use these reflection objects to access fields, invoke methods, or instantiate instances, all without having compile-time dependencies on those features. The Java runtime provides the corresponding classes for reflection. Most of the Java classes that support reflection are in the java.lang.reflect package. Reflection is most useful for performing dynamic operations with Java â€” operations that are not hard-coded into a source program, but that are determined at run time. One of the most important aspects of reflection is dynamic class loading.

<li>The syntax of Java is largely influenced by C++. Unlike C++, which combines the syntax for structured, generic, and object-oriented programming, Java was built almost exclusively as an object-oriented language.[15] All code is written inside classes, and every data item is an object, with the exception of the primitive data types, i.e. integers, floating-point numbers, boolean values, and characters, which are not objects for performance reasons. Java reuses some popular aspects of C++ (such as printf() method).
